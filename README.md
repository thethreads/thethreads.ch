# Development

To setup your development environment...

1. Setup Node.js
2. Run `npm install` in this directory
3. To compile (and watch) the LESS files (located in `style/`, run `npm run watch-css`

The final compiled and combined CSS file is located in `dist/`.
Make sure to commit the compiled CSS whenever you commit changes to the `.less` source files!
